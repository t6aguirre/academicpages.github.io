I am an Economics student at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP), set to graduate in 2024. With a passion for AI governance, industrial organization, and public economics, I have gained substantial experience as a research assistant in various projects, ranging from economic history to AI market dynamics. My technical skills include proficiency in Python, R, SQL, and Stata, among others.

Currently, I work as a Data Scientist and Researcher at Palver, a startup that tracks public debate on platforms like WhatsApp and TikTok. I recently concluded my role at the Cambridge Boston-Alignment Initiative, where I researched AI supply chain market dynamics. Now, I am excited to start as a part-time Research Assistant at the Centre for the Governance of AI, assisting Sam Manning on a project examining AI's impact on the USA labor market.

My previous roles include a summer fellowship at the Swiss Existential Risk Initiative and internships at Giant Steps Capital and i4 Economic Regulation. I have also been actively involved in economics education and competitions, serving on the executive board of the International Economics Olympiad and coordinating the Brazilian Economics Olympiad.

Fluent in Portuguese and English, with basic Spanish proficiency, I am dedicated to advancing the understanding of economic systems and AI's impact on society.
